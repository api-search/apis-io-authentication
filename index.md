title: APIs.io Authentication API Docs
---
This API is used to authenticate with the APIs.io API, using a personal access token from your GitHub account to validate and create an API key you can use to make calls to the APIs.io.

    .info{
        display: none;
    }
    .scheme-container{
        padding: 0px;
        margin: 0px;
    }
</style>
We wanted to make it as easy as possible to setup your API key without having to create yet another account you will have to manage, so we make the assumption you at least already have a GitHub account--next we'll fire up LinkedIn and Google.
