title: APIs.io Authentication API Docs

This API is used to authenticate with the APIs.io API, using a personal access token from your GitHub account to validate and create an API key you can use to make calls to the APIs.io.

    .info{
        display: none;

We are just getting started developing these APIs and they will change rapidly, we don't recommend building anything production around them at this point, until they mature a little bit more.
